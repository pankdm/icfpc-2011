Snakes vs. Lambdas
==================

This bot has the following features:

1) Brain, i.e. emulator that computes the current situation after each move. Some teams try to break it using memory
   leaks, we try to avoid it.

2) The algorithm is the following cycle:
   a) "Infinite" healing of the first slot. "Infinite" means that we use recursion for healing, and if there were no
      restriction for application counts, then we would heal forever. We store our healing function in another slot,
	  so the second healing will be faster. But we check if our healing function is damaged and if yes, we rebuild it.
   b) Two early attacks (the first attacks are on 64 and 70 moves, we think it is pretty fast). We choose "the best"
      enemy slot and attack it and it's neighbour. Again, our function is stored and rebuiled if neccesary.

3) Also if our enemy revives his slots, we begin to use zombies that do nothing, but they overwrite enemies functions
   in their dead slots.

4) Our first 5 slots are very important for us, because they contain neccesary functions and numbers. We check if they
   are dead, and if yes, we revive them and rebuild their contents.
